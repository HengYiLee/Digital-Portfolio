      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/adheesh-katru/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Automated Plantation</a>      
      <p>I enjoyed the prospect of assisting others with the food created by this invention. However, I rejected this project because plants can grow in suitable conditions even without automation. The project also isn’t specific enough, because different plants have extremely variable tolerances for the variables listed out, and a suitable condition for one can be unsuitable for another.
      </p>
      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/aaron-berdecia/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">2D Survival Game</a>      
      <p>I enjoyed the prospect of creating a game which I could enjoy with others. However, I rejected this project because this concept has been made several times, and with varying themes and ideas. This concept simply feels like less than I can do, and doesn’t push my skills.
      </p>
      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/akshay-vemulapalli/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">DX3</a>      
      <p>
	I enjoyed the idea of using this product for myself. However, I rejected this project because the project felt like less than my best effort. DX3 could simply induce the stimulus on a regular interval, and still keep me awake without the use of facial expressions.
      </p>
      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/andrew-liu/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Rogue-Like Game</a>      
      <p>
	I enjoyed the idea of being able to play my own project. However, I rejected this project because the project has been done before, and to near perfection. I’m also unsure as to whether we will be able to acquire the necessary tools to complete the project.
      </p>
      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/andrew-nguyen/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Restaurant Picker</a>      
      <p>
	I enjoyed the prospect of solving disputes between a group on where to eat. However, I rejected this project because there are already several well known free services which display exactly the same details which the restaurant picker will.
      </p>
      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/andrewm-lin/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">The Cafe Project</a>      
      <p>
	I enjoyed the prospect of reducing the amount of time required for lunches. However, I rejected this project because there are already several services and applications which have done exactly what this project aims to do.
      </p>
      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/aryan-bhuta/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Tempora</a>      
      <p>
	I enjoyed the prospect of the story and narrative that the project was heading towards. However, I rejected this project because the details supplied for the project were vague and could lead to misunderstandings along with an unclear game path, leading to either incompletion or a bad game.
      </p>
      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/aryan-kulkarni/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Eagle Card</a>      
      <p>
	I enjoyed the prospect of the school modernizing towards the level of a company. However, I rejected this project because the project would never be accepted by Allen High School due to their misplaced funding.
      </p>
      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/austin-dlugosch/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">TV360</a>      
      <p>
	I enjoyed the prospect of the TV being free to move wherever you would want it to be for convenience. However, I rejected this project because things that are extremely similar to this already exist, and at an affordable price too. 
      </p>
      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/ayaan-kashyap/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Game Skin Modification</a>      
      <p>
	I enjoyed the prospect of saving many people money on in game items. However, I rejected this project because the game itself would fight to counter this as its their main source of revenue for keeping the game running at all.
      </p>
      <a href="https://codermerlin.com/users/heng-yi-lee/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Automatic Window Shade</a>      
      <p>
	I enjoyed the prospect of saving energy, and money all while helping the environment with something cheap and convenient. I accepted this project as it seemed at the correct level of CS difficulty, with all of the aforementioned benefits.
