      <h2>Planning for the Week</h2>
      <p>
	My issue will be to link the raspberry pi with the code, which will merge both the hardware and software together to have a product that will hopefully move. With Alan correcting the API to work correctly this week, we will hopefully by the end of the week have the completed product.

      <h2>Planning for the Week</h2>
      <p>
	For this week we plan to correct the connection between the chosen weather API and our website. Both applications work fine on their own, but the implementation of the weather API to the thermostat of the website does not work. The thermostat only shows 'Loading...' instead of the fetched temperature from the Accuweather API which is the text put for if the API has not loaded. The gantt chart also requires updating as it has been sorely neglected for a period of time.

      <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
      <p>
	Technical challenges this week included finishing the code of the raspberry pi that we would use. Soldering on the raspberry pi continued, but progress was still slow. The website to control the temperature utilizing the blinds was expanded on. The ability to learn was hindered by several other projects from other classes. Links below.

      <p>
	Technical challenges this week included restructuring what our product would be in its completed form. We were able to receive feedback on the plan, and reworked the project to meet requirements which we had not thought about. Specifically, our creation of an application to control the window shade when necessary. This meant that the whole project had to have another layer of complexity on top of it.

      <p>
	Technical challenges this week included the finding of tools that could be used to construct the hardware, and the software for the curtain. Progress was made in finding tools for both hardware and software, and we are researching into how much the materials to construct the hardware would cost. 
      </p>
      <h2>Scheduling Challenges</h2>
      <p>
	Due to all team members this week being extremely busy with school activities, scheduling a time that worked with all of us was not possible, or not easy. Therefore, we individually worked on the project while communicating to each other text messages or when we were able to talk in person.

	Technical challenges this week included a team member being ill, which led to their absence. However, communication was still possible between all team members to iterate to the ill team member what had occured.

      <h2>Scheduling Challenges</h2>
      <p>
	Due to a team member being ill, it was not possible for all team members to meet in person and dicuss the project. However, messages could still be communicated over the internet to the ill team member, and for the ill team member to communicate with the rest of the group.

      <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
      <p>
	Technical Challenges this week included looking into the software requirements for our project. Specifically the APIs for the weather were seen, and the decision to use it has been discussed, but not set in place. The group is unsure as to whether or not only use the light sensor, or just it concurrently with information from the weather API.
      </p>
      <h2>Scheduling Challenges</h2>
      <p>
	There were few scheduling challenges this week. One of them was finding out when all group members were available to meet to work on the project in the future. A solution that was found was that we all work independently and then communicate either over text or another messaging service to the other team members on what has been accomplished and what still has to be done.

      <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
      <p>
	Technical Challenges this week included finding the necessary components that our group has outlined as necessary. However, some of these items were decently expensive. Therefore, our group looked for alternative solutions for the possible materials that we required. We were able to lower costs of some materials through finding some of them already in our possession. We will look further into other alternatives. 
      </p>
      <h2>Scheduling Challenges</h2>
      <p>
	There were only a handful of scheduling challenges this week. One of them was finding out when all group members were available to meet to work on the project in the future. A solution that was found was that we could either use a call to communicate with each other if we could not physically meet, or to have only two of the three members meet if they were available, and then catch up the individual who was not present due to scheduling conflicts.

      <h2>Software Development Engineer</h2>
      <p>Software Development Engineers create, design, and test software which solves issues required by others. They regularly debug code and improve it based on the requirements necessary. Also, they commonly work in teams to handle larger tasks more efficiently, and work with other teams such as user experience and quality assurance to produce a seemless product. I believe I would be a good role for this position as I am adept at coding, and am able to easily work in teams and with other teams.</p>
      <h2>Quality Assurance Engineer</h2>
      <p>A Quality Assurance Engineer is responsible for ensuring that the finished product meets the necessary requirements and quality of the product requested. Quality Assurance Engineers commonly execute the tasks that are required of the product, and analyse the results. They then improve the quality of the product if possible. I believe I would be a good role for this position as I have done this in the past, and have already learned how to effectively fulfill the requirements of this position.</p>
      <h2>Project Manager</h2>
      <p>A Project Manager plans, manages, and organizes resources to complete the creation of a product that is satisfactory for the requirements needed. They commonly plan the schedule and timeline of the project, and facilitate communication between different teams. Also, they provide leadership for the teams, and ensure the completion of a suitable product within the quality that is required. I believe I would make a decent role for this position as I am able to handle logistics relatively well, but lack leadership skills.
      </p>
      <h2>Product Manager</h2>
      <p>A Product Manager ensure the success of a product, and hold the vision for the finished product, and the removal of obstacles that negatively impact that production of the product. They commonly work with other teams to create the product, and understand the requirements which determines the priority of what is completed. I believe I would make a mediocre product manager as I am able to complete logistics, but have a difficult time envisioning a complete path of how to complete something on a large scale.
