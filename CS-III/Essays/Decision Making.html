    <h2 class="essayHeader">Biases that Impact Decision Making</h2>
    
    <p class="essay">Decision-making biases are cognitive errors that can distort our thinking and lead us to make poor choices. These biases can arise from a variety of sources, such as our emotions, cognitive limitations, or the influence of others. They can affect our judgment in important areas such as finance, politics, and personal relationships. In this essay, we will discuss some of the decision-making biases that will negatively impact my group’s independent study project (ISP), and strategies that will mitigate each of these biases.</p>
    <p class="essay">A bias that I believe may impact my ISP’s team-making decision processes would be confirmation bias. Confirmation bias is the tendency to only search for information that confirms your beliefs and creates a lack of research on the opposing side of the side that is trying to be proven. Due to this, a lack of perspectives is created, and there will only be ideas that support the proven information but only due to a lack of effort in searching for opposing information. When only evidence supporting the claims made is searched for, a dangerous negligence of information is created. This negligence leads to false beliefs about ideas and may lead to believing information that is not correct. A simple personal solution to this would be to always argue against oneself or have another person argue against oneself.</p>
    <p class="essay">Another bias that I believe would negatively impact my ISP team’s decision process would be the phenomenon of GroupThink. GroupThink is the phenomenon of all individuals in a group agreeing with one another, and no opposing idea or other idea is proposed that may or may not be better than the original idea. The lack of individual thinking creates a hivemind that only agrees with itself, and ignores other ideas that may be better. I intend to overcome GroupThink by thinking about ideas that are not presented by the group, or thinking about ideas when the group is not there, and then presenting the idea to them after.</p>
    <p class="essay">Continuing onward, another bias that may impact my team’s decision-making process would be the overconfidence effect. The overconfidence effect is when one is significantly more confident in one’s answers rather than the reality of things (Dobelli, 2013). This could have major implications when group members believe the false confident conclusions made, rather than the reality of the situation. To prevent the overconfidence effect, I will both get a neutral third-party opinion and look at the reality of the situation to see whether or not it truly is as I believe it to be.</p>
    <p class="essay">An additional bias that may impact my team’s decision-making process would be the contrast effect. The contrast effect is the alteration of a certain belief by comparing it with another belief that contrasts it (Caccavale, 2020). This has a large impact on what ideas could be chosen by my ISP group and may lead to negative choices made that will lead to overall harm for our ISP project. To prevent this, I will simply not compare the beliefs when they significantly contrast, and only contrast in realistic scenarios.</p>
    <p class="essay">An important bias that will impact my team’s decision-making process is the G.I. Joe Fallacy. The G.I. Joe Fallacy is the tendency to think that knowing about a cognitive bias is enough to overcome it (Kristal & Santos). This will impact our ISP group as we all have decision-making biases, and simply knowing that we have them is not enough to mitigate their impacts. To prevent this, there are listed strategies under every bias brought up before that will ensure that one does not fall into the G.I. Joe Fallacy.</p>
    <p class="essay">To conclude, decision-making biases are a common problem that can have significant negative impacts on our ability to make rational decisions. By understanding the various types of decision-making biases and how they can affect us, we can take steps to mitigate their impact and improve our decision-making processes. This can help us to make more informed, rational, and effective decisions, ultimately leading to better outcomes for ourselves and those around us.</p>
