      <h1>Sentient AI is beneficial but will not lead to a utopia for humans.</h1>
    </div>
    <div style="padding-left:16px; text-indent: 50px;">
      <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) today already has a massive impact on day to day life for many humans. From AI generated artwork to self driving cars, and recommendation algorithms, AI has already benefited many humans. Sentient AI would simply be more efficient humans if they were sentient in the way that humans were. This increased efficiency would most likely greatly benefit humans, as there would effectively be more people who could create more inventions that would help many people, such as the cure to cancer.</p>
      <p>Lastly, there is a logical issue with creating a utopia, with or without sentient AI. A utopia is a place where everything is perfect, and a place with humans will never be perfect for everybody. A simple way to imagine this would be two individuals within a place that both want to be the richest individual there. However, no perfect scenario exists as this cannot be true for both of them, and therefore a utopia would not be possible. There are many more scenarios as humans have more than just a single desire.</p>
