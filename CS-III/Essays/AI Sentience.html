    <h2 class="essayHeader">Sentient AI is Beneficial But Will Not Lead to a Utopia For Humans</h2>
    
    <p class="essay">Artificial intelligence (AI) today already has a massive impact on day-to-day life for many humans. From AI-generated artwork to self-driving cars, and recommendation algorithms, AI has already benefited many humans. Currently, AI is not sentient and is far from sentience(Metz, 2022). Sentient AI would simply be more efficient than humans if they were sentient in the way that humans were. This increased efficiency would most likely greatly benefit humans, as there would effectively be more people who could create more inventions that would help many people, such as the cure to cancer. However, sentience has several definitions and ranges from simply feeling something to feeling emotions and understanding sensations. An animal such as a cow could be considered sentient, because it feels pain.</p>
    <p class="essay">AI has already surpassed humans in several areas of knowledge. We can already see this with art today, as AI creates extremely detailed images using input descriptions as words (Roose, 2022). The level of detail and precision surpasses most humans and matches even the level of photographs. AI can even create art in different styles from humans. Additionally, this technology is extremely new and can be further improved to increase the detail and precision relating to the prompt given (Roose, 2022). Another area in which AI has surpassed humans would be chess. All current top-level chess players train their matches with chess engines because they can figure out the best moves game after game, and win continuously against even the best chess player in the world. Chess engines are so much better than humans that instead of playing against humans, they play against other chess engines to train themselves as humans aren't a sufficient challenge. AI has even surpassed humanity in driving, a task that has been repeated by humans day after day (Roose, 2022). AI has been proven to have the capability to surpass human reflexes and drive safer than many humans.</p>
    <p class="essay">However, humans are still able to surpass AI in conceptual knowledge, such as emotions or morals. An AI is less capable of recognizing whether something is sad or happy and in pain or suffering. AI is unable to create new knowledge based on knowledge already known, unlike humans. In addition, AI is unable to create new knowledge (Metz, 2022). An AI cannot create new mathematical equations from examples or create a new chemical compound with beneficial traits based on previous chemicals. </p>
    <p class="essay">Lastly, there is a logical issue with creating a utopia, with or without sentient AI. A utopia is a place where everything is perfect, and a place with humans will never be perfect for everybody. A simple way to imagine this would be two individuals within a place that both want to be the richest individual there. However, no perfect scenario exists as this cannot be true for both of them, and therefore a utopia would not be possible. There are many more scenarios as humans have more than just a single desire.</p>
