      <h1>2-May-2023: Chegg</h1>
      <p>With the rollout of AI, access to information has been easier than ever. From language assistence from Microsoft to ChatGPT giving answers to almost everything for free, answers have been easier than ever. However, this has caused difficulties for other services which used to provide that role, such as chegg which required money for a decent experience as most of their services were locked behind a paywall. With their business model completely destroyed, they are now forced to compete with a free service that gives better answers than chegg usually. Chegg now will have to pivot their role to what AI cannot currently reach, which is some math as they do not have exponents or subtext on ChatGPT. However, with the progress of AI that will probably soon occur and nullify the one semi-untouched part of their business.</p>
