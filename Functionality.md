# Feature 1
Map which shows the location of selected classes

### Functionality

For each class that gets selected, the map will be updated with the room number of the class, which then puts the locations on the map. As classes are selected, the map will create paths between the classes, which can be helpful for when school actually starts. These paths will change as the ammount AND order of the classes change. Also, a piece of text which has been modified to show a chronological list of the halls of the classes will be made. For example, suppose the locations of the classes shown are as follows: F123, G213, G321, A543. Then, a piece of text along the lines of "1st: F hall, 2nd: G hall, 3rd: G hall, 4th: A hall" will be made.

### Design
Tab titled "Map", which has a location of all the room numbers + classes taught in those rooms. After selecting classes, it will show the room number of said class, and the location of the room relative to the building. Classes which are chosen are highlighted. Also draws a path between the classes based on the order of the schedule. There will be a key near the map, which shows a correlation between class periods and a color. For example, "1st - 2nd period: Red", and a line showing those the path between those 2 classes will be made in that color. This will be in a sperate tabe than the area where classes are actually selected, so that the screen doesnt look cluttered. There will also be an option to expand or shrink the map.

# Feature 4

 The program will tell you what classes you need for graduation, and complete your selected endrosment

### Functionality

First off, when you open the app for the first time there will appear a questionaire asking you about your previously completed class requirements. These questions include: what grade you're in (9, 10, 11, 12), how many math classes have you taken (0,1,2,3,4+),how many english classes have you taken (0,1,2,3,4+), how many science classes have you taken (0,1,2,3,4+), how many history classes have you taken (0,1,2,3,4+), how many language classes have you taken (0, 1, or 2+), how many PE classes have you taken (0, 1+), how many fine arts have you taken (0, 1+), how many electives have you taken (0,1,2,3,4,5,6+). After filling out the questionaire, there will be another pop-up screen telling them the requirements they have left. This is of course can be otional, and there will be a skip button atb the bottom of the pop, incase they would rather not know their requirements or only need the arena scheduling to see how their schedules will fit. This questionaire will help students realize if they need to choose different classes. For exampel they could be a senior realizing they need another language class in order to graduate. 

	
### Design

The design will consist of a rectangular pop-up when one first opens up the app. The option to skip will be on the bottom right corner in a different colored button. It will be an off-white background, unless it is in dark mode in which it will be midnight grey, and the text will be a contrast color for readability purposes. Utilizing cookies, the pop-up will not appear in the user's second or future visits. There will be a progress bar at the top or bottom to mark how far one is in completing the quiz. The progress bar color will be grey when uncomplete while the bar filling up will be eagle blue. The questions will come one after another, instead of a long scrolling view, and will be strictly multiple choice questions. The questions will fade in on each other instead of just being replaces for aethetic purposes, or will be slid on screen depending on the choice given to the Ui/Ux designers.

### QA

To assure the quality of this function, we must make sure that the questionaire and the pop-up it is on will be easy to use and free of bugs. Possible problems that could occur include... Not saving answers, locking them out, not letting them take the quiz, buttons not clicking, not being able to exit the quiz. These are all examples of potential bugs when making this feature. The best way to resolve each of these issues is by making an issue report section where kids can report issues. There will also be a lot of testing before adding this function to the main design. The most devestating issue with this function will probably be the unability to exit the quiz b/c that means there is no way to be able to progress and use the app for what it was ORIGINALLY intended for.

# Feature 6

Shows GPA scale of the class

### Functionality
Whan classes are picked, there will be an option to view details of individual classes, and all the classes picked. it will recieve data of the GPA scaling of said class or classes. For example: If the chosen class is Computer Science II, it will recieve data to show that the class has a gpa on a 4.5 scale. After picking multiple classes, It will show the maximum GPA which is possible with those classes, along with level change alternatives. There will also be options to change the class level, so it is more convinient for the user. If all classes required are not picked, there will be a warning when showing the "maximum of all classes", that this number may change as classes change or get added.

### Design
When classes are picked, there will be an option which is titled "More Information" which has general information. In this tab, there will be a long bar which ranged from 0.0 to 5.0, which is the range from 0 to the maximum GPA's for the classes. If a it is on the option for which shows a specific class, it will highlight from 0 - the maximum GPA for that class. For example: Suppose you are viewing the GPA scale of a class worth 4.5. Everything below the 4.5 mark would be one color, and everything above the 4.5 mark would be grey. If the option to show the  maximum gpa possible is selected, it will average the maximum GPA's of all of the chosen classes, and everything below that point would be hightlighted a certain color and everything above that point would be grey.
