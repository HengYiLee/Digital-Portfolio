# Feature 4

 The program will tell you what classes you need for graduation, and complete your selected endrosment

### Functionality

First off, when you open the app for the first time there will appear a questionaire asking you about your previously completed class requirements. These questions include: what grade you're in (9, 10, 11, 12), how many math classes have you taken (0,1,2,3,4+),how many english classes have you taken (0,1,2,3,4+), how many science classes have you taken (0,1,2,3,4+), how many history classes have you taken (0,1,2,3,4+), how many language classes have you taken (0, 1, or 2+), how many PE classes have you taken (0, 1+), how many fine arts have you taken (0, 1+), how many electives have you taken (0,1,2,3,4,5,6+). After filling out the questionaire, there will be another pop-up screen telling them the requirements they have left. This is of course can be otional, and there will be a skip button atb the bottom of the pop, incase they would rather not know their requirements or only need the arena scheduling to see how their schedules will fit. This questionaire will help students realize if they need to choose different classes. For exampel they could be a senior realizing they need another language class in order to graduate. 

	
### Design

The design will consist of a rectangular pop-up when one first opens up the app. The option to skip will be on the bottom right corner in a different colored button. It will be an off-white background, unless it is in dark mode in which it will be midnight grey, and the text will be a contrast color for readability purposes. Utilizing cookies, the pop-up will not appear in the user's second or future visits. There will be a progress bar at the top or bottom to mark how far one is in completing the quiz. The progress bar color will be grey when uncomplete while the bar filling up will be eagle blue. The questions will come one after another, instead of a long scrolling view, and will be strictly multiple choice questions. The questions will fade in on each other instead of just being replaces for aethetic purposes, or will be slid on screen depending on the choice given to the Ui/Ux designers.

### QA

To assure the quality of this function, we must make sure that the questionaire and the pop-up it is on will be easy to use and free of bugs. Possible problems that could occur include... Not saving answers, locking them out, not letting them take the quiz, buttons not clicking, not being able to exit the quiz. These are all examples of potential bugs when making this feature. The best way to resolve each of these issues is by making an issue report section where kids can report issues. There will also be a lot of testing before adding this function to the main design. The most devestating issue with this function will probably be the unability to exit the quiz b/c that means there is no way to be able to progress and use the app for what it was ORIGINALLY intended for. 

# Feature 5

Course Popularity Scale

### Functionality
The popularity or percentage of students scheduled in a class should be displayed so that students can quickly choose the more popular courses.
Fetches data from other student's reservation of courses, and displays that on a bar scale that identifies the popularity of that course. Takes into consideration if the student selecting the course has taken the required prerequisites for that course.

### Design
Displays the bar scale onto a sub-menu that appears when the user hovers the cursor over the course. It will contain a set number of grey bars that will be colored in to correspond to how popular it is among other students (ex. Popular classes will have all the boxes filled in with red, whereas less popular classes will only have a few green boxes); color will indicate how much room is left to join the course. The color of the sub-menu will correspond to which light/dark theme the user has selected.

### QA 
If the feature is working properly, a bar scale will be displayed onto the sub-menu of the course, identifying the correct popularity percentage of that class. If a problem occurs, an error message will be displayed, identifying the corresponding error (ex. Wrong percentage, no bar scale, etc.),  which will let our team know which aspect to work on.

Change background colors (light/DARK VADER mode) 

### Functionality

Baiscally within your setting options you should be able to choose the background colors of the app to what is most aesthetically pleasing to you. You have your two baisc options Light mode and Dark mode, as well as a advadvanced option of a color wheel to make a background color of your preference. If you want to include a color code, there will be an option for that as well in whihc you can enter a color code into the search box option and have that as your background color. Once you've chosen your select color, there will be a save button which will save your background color for future revisits of the app. 
	For the secondary colors like the text, and other buttons on the app, it will automatically set as a contrast color in order to maxamize the ease of use. There also might be restrictions on which colors you are able to choose. For example, neon colors like a extremley bright yellow might be harmful for the vision of these viewers and therefore be banned. This will be used to personalize each users app, and make it more user interactive.  
	
### Design

### QA
	
Some errors that might be included in this particular feature is colors not saving, certain colors give eyestrain and were not banned, colors will not change from default setting, contrast color not good for the current background color in use. Other issues might be not being able to get out of the settings window, and colors not matching with its description. Another issue might be colors do ot fill the entire page, or possibly colors used in a different background besides the main background available.
	Of course the best way to find these issues, will be through intenst testing, as well as some research on which colors might cause eyestrain, and problems for viewing. Another way to fix these issues is through the reporting through bug issues. Mostly these issues will probably be through HTML, and website coding. 

# Feature 16

Prerequisites of classes 

### Functionality

	The user will be able to, upon clicking on the class, to see the required prerequisites or see it on the short description. There will also be an option after clicking the classes to be able to click on the prerequisite classes and see the description for the prerequisite. This process will continue until there are no prerequisites remaining. The class that comes after will also be mentioned and linked and if the class is part of a pathway, the pathway will be mentioned as well.
	Another option will include recommended or related classes. These classes are not required, for example principles of engineering with computere science, but are reccommended for specific career paths or further understanding. These classes will also be linkable and one can navigate to find these classes if they are interested to do so.

### Design

	The prerequisites and other classes mentioned will all be underlined and in a cobalt blue, or yellow when in dark mode. Colors are still up for discussion for the designers of the app, however. Hovering over the prerequisites will show the link the class link will lead to in the alt text. The font will not change, however, for consistency reasons, as well will the size of the font. 
	The pages the link will lead to will just be the class descriptions on the side. When asking for a full list, the list will replace the "classes list" on the left. The background color will stay the same as well as the font and text colors in the rectangle.
