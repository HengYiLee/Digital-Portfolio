# Feature 4

 The program will tell you what classes you need for graduation, and complete your selected endrosment

### Functionality

First off, when you open the app for the first time there will appear a questionaire asking you about your previously completed class requirements. These questions include: what grade you're in (9, 10, 11, 12), how many math classes have you taken (0,1,2,3,4+),how many english classes have you taken (0,1,2,3,4+), how many science classes have you taken (0,1,2,3,4+), how many history classes have you taken (0,1,2,3,4+), how many language classes have you taken (0, 1, or 2+), how many PE classes have you taken (0, 1+), how many fine arts have you taken (0, 1+), how many electives have you taken (0,1,2,3,4,5,6+). After filling out the questionaire, there will be another pop-up screen telling them the requirements they have left. This is of course can be otional, and there will be a skip button atb the bottom of the pop, incase they would rather not know their requirements or only need the arena scheduling to see how their schedules will fit. This questionaire will help students realize if they need to choose different classes. For exampel they could be a senior realizing they need another language class in order to graduate. 

	
### Design

The design will consist of a rectangular pop-up when one first opens up the app. The option to skip will be on the bottom right corner in a different colored button. It will be an off-white background, unless it is in dark mode in which it will be midnight grey, and the text will be a contrast color for readability purposes. Utilizing cookies, the pop-up will not appear in the user's second or future visits. There will be a progress bar at the top or bottom to mark how far one is in completing the quiz. The progress bar color will be grey when uncomplete while the bar filling up will be eagle blue. The questions will come one after another, instead of a long scrolling view, and will be strictly multiple choice questions. The questions will fade in on each other instead of just being replaces for aethetic purposes, or will be slid on screen depending on the choice given to the Ui/Ux designers.

### QA

To assure the quality of this function, we must make sure that the questionaire and the pop-up it is on will be easy to use and free of bugs. Possible problems that could occur include... Not saving answers, locking them out, not letting them take the quiz, buttons not clicking, not being able to exit the quiz. These are all examples of potential bugs when making this feature. The best way to resolve each of these issues is by making an issue report section where kids can report issues. There will also be a lot of testing before adding this function to the main design. The most devestating issue with this function will probably be the unability to exit the quiz b/c that means there is no way to be able to progress and use the app for what it was ORIGINALLY intended for.

Course summary

### Functionality
This can be access when a student click's on the class and would be given a course description about the learning the students will be engaged in. In this summary in can include types of learning students will participate in such as labs, projects, group collaborations etc. It would also have specified topics in the course itself like it the class were to be United States History main information about the subject could be American Independence and the Civil War. It should list the difficulty of the class so that students can be assured that the teaching in the subject matches the student's comprehension and work ethic. Lastly the summary will contain the bar scale of popularity, tells the percent of students that are interested in taking the class, so that learners can find themselves with their friends to better improve overall learning and cooperation efforts among them. Comprising of elements above, course summary will provide generalized information that would be sufficient enough to give students a basic understanding of the course to help them in deciding on the classes they would take.

### Design
	The course summary would appear once the student clicks on any particular class as they would be taken to the course description housing all sorts of information. When clicking on the button a new page will open up that consists of either black-or-white background with a contrasting color of text for the information in the summary. The new page will be in the middle of the screen easy for the user to see. Information should be that of the teacher's input on the page that each teacher will be forced to create.

### QA
In order to check whether this feature meets the requirements we would make sure we debug the potential problems that may occur. This could be inaccess to the summary when clicking on the course, failing to exit the course description where the summary is, information of the summary is invalid. These challenges may cause the user to struggle but can be reported through the customer service system in our app. Also students can probably refresh the page and try another attempt in viewing the course summary. 

# Feature 10

Rate my teacher system and could comment about the teacher

### Functionality
 This can be from data from students from the previous year who would like to provide data or express their opinions on the teacher they had. This could be very important as it allows for students who feel strongly about the teachers, whether good or bad, but more importantly gives insight to future learners who are interested in this type of class in understanding the professor. A more in-depth rating from the seniors would be the ability for students to leave comments on the teacher's describing experiences in their class. This furthermore could give significant data for faculty to be able to distinguish teachers that need guidance or those who deserve praise. Many students in our high school always want to know whether their future teachers are good or bad and based off this fact it could directly influence a students work ethic in the class being a more demanding teacher wants more work while a laid-back one would make the students less studious. On top of this these kids could view the comments to picture in their head how the class will flow and this could match their wants or needs.

### Design
To find the teacher rate/comment system it will be located in one of the menu's where it will have a database of all the teacher's name and class they would have. If you want to learn about the rating then click on the teacher and it would perform as a drop-down menu and show in bolded characters, with the text contrasting the background(black-or-white), illustrate the average rating a person receives. Here it would also below this give the feedback on both extremes of loving or hating the teachers, that is if the information is present, so that students can get fellow peer feedback. Probably we would make this look better by adding the image of the teacher. To be able to leave a comment and rate, there will be a button on this drop-down allocating access to give a rating out of a five  point scale with the optional feature of commenting. 

### QA
 In order to ensure this feature works properly we would thoroughly check the correct information for each page. Some type of problems that may occur would be false information of the teacher, failed to implement individual comments or rating, drop-down menu fails to operate, rating values placed in inversely (if I rate my teacher a five it puts it as a one). Again we would implement customer service in order to immediately solve these problems here and we would also check our database to properly match up the teacher information between one another. I big problem would be being locked on the page where the student provides their ideals since they may not be able to leave nor their data would be sent to the server.
