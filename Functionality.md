# Feature 4

 The program will tell you what classes you need for graduation, and complete your selected endrosment

### Functionality

	First off, when you open the app for the first time there will appear a questionaire asking you about your previously completed class requirements. These questions include: what grade you're in (9, 10, 11, 12), how many math classes have you taken (0,1,2,3,4+),how many english classes have you taken (0,1,2,3,4+), how many science classes have you taken (0,1,2,3,4+), how many history classes have you taken (0,1,2,3,4+), how many language classes have you taken (0, 1, or 2+), how many PE classes have you taken (0, 1+), how many fine arts have you taken (0, 1+), how many electives have you taken (0,1,2,3,4,5,6+). After filling out the questionaire, there will be another pop-up screen telling them the requirements they have left.
	This is of course can be otional, and there will be a skip button atb the bottom of the pop, incase they would rather not know their requirements or only need the arena scheduling to see how their schedules will fit. This questionaire will help students realize if they need to choose different classes. For exampel they could be a senior realizing they need another language class in order to graduate. 

	
### Design

	The design will consist of a rectangular pop-up when one first opens up the app. The option to skip will be on the bottom right corner in a different colored button. It will be an off-white background, unless it is in dark mode in which it will be midnight grey, and the text will be a contrast color for readability purposes. Utilizing cookies, the pop-up will not appear in the user's second or future visits. 
	There will be a progress bar at the top or bottom to mark how far one is in completing the quiz. The progress bar color will be grey when uncomplete while the bar filling up will be eagle blue. The questions will come one after another, instead of a long scrolling view, and will be strictly multiple choice questions. The questions will fade in on each other instead of just being replaces for aethetic purposes, or will be slid on screen depending on the choice given to the Ui/Ux designers.

### QA

	To assure the quality of this function, we must make sure that the questionaire and the pop-up it is on will be easy to use and free of bugs. Possible problems that could occur include... Not saving answers, locking them out, not letting them take the quiz, buttons not clicking, not being able to exit the quiz. These are all examples of potential bugs when making this feature.
	The best way to resolve each of these issues is by making an issue report section where kids can report issues. There will also be a lot of testing before adding this function to the main design. The most devestating issue with this function will probably be the unability to exit the quiz b/c that means there is no way to be able to progress and use the app for what it was ORIGINALLY intended for.
