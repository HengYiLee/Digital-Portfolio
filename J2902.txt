What did I learn today? What is the "big idea"?
I learned about the tools which the team will use for the project, their functionality and why we will use them.  
What challenges did I encounter?
A major challenge I encountered was not knowing all of the tools which would be used for this project due to the vast array of neccessities for these tools.
How has what I've learned impacted my thinking?
This has impacted my thinking by making me realize the array of tools used to complete large projects such as the one we will complete.
