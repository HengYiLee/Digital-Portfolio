1. The MVC paradigm is the model, view, controller paradigm.
2. The benefit of using this paradigm is that the communication between the model, view, and controller allow for interactions between the server and client.
3. The paradigm is designed to increasing coupling because it makes sure the server and client are not independent of each other.
4. It is possible for multiple views to be associated with the same model, and an example would be the views of clients in a game all connecting to one model.
