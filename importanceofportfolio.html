      <h1>Importance of My Digital Portfolio</h1>
      <p>This digital portfolio is important to me as it is a record of my progression through the subject of Computer Science. I am able to track my accomplishments so far, and the projects in the future that I am currently planning. The story of how I am in computer science is told throughout this digital portfolio. This allows me to reflect on myself and what I have done with my time in computer science. With this reflection, I can grow even more.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the creation of this digital portfolio helps me develop soft skills, such as communication, organization, and problem solving. Digital portfolios require individuals to communicate their experiences and present them in an easily digestable way to others. It gives me the opportunity to reflect on projects, goals and track growth over time.</p>
